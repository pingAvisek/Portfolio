## Improvements

- Not working hovering on live site.
- Scroll bar designing.
- decrease font size of banner other than Name.
- Social media links on mobile devices (make flex wrap for small devices).

## Bugs

- I was not able to change the colors of navlinks of with respective brand color while hovering only as I heard Tailwind CSS can't compile dynamic classes. Hope to fix it soon. For now I have given the color to react icons component itself.
